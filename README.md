FILTER IMAGE

Beneath is another screenshot from my webpage where the the user of the page will be able to filter the data.

The way this works is that the user will enter or type the city or state abbrevation in the filter search as an input box, then when you click out of the box,or press the enter key, the table will automatically update to the citeria that has been filtered.

For example, if the user wanted to see all of the UFO sightings in the city of "ar", they would enter "ar" in the city input box and the table would update to show only the data for that city.

A little concern about this filtering system is that a user will have to  apply the input so that the table will update every time the user clicks out of the input box. For a novice who might not really understand systems and the logic behind getting additional information This can be a bit distracting for the user and can make it difficult to see the data that is being filtered. They may not be aware that they need to click an input box.

I would recommendation for further development that  would be to continuously update the table as the user types in the input box. This would allow the user to see the data that is being filtered as they type and would make it easier to see the data that is being filtered.
