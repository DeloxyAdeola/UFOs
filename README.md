# UFOs
The main  purpose of this project is to build a webpage that displays UFO sightings from a data.js file and also creat a function that allows the users to filter that data. My webpage was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with additional functionality provided by Bootstrap and D3.js. 

Results
The data on the webpage is originally shown in a table format as such:

The user can filter the data by entering a value in the input box and when clicking out of the box, the table will automatically update to show only the data that matches the filter criteria.

For example, if the user wanted to see all of the UFO sightings in the city of San Diego, they would enter "san diego" in the state input box and the table would update to show only the data for that city:

The user can then filter the data with the following categories (placeholder text is shown in the input boxes to help the user know what to enter):

Summary
A little concern about this filtering system is that a user willhave to  apply the input so that the table will update every time the user clicks out of the input box. For a novice who might not really understand systems and the logic behind getting additional information This can be a bit distracting for the user and can make it difficult to see the data that is being filtered. They may not be aware that they need to click an input box.

I would recommendation for further development that  would be to continuously update the table as the user types in the input box. This would allow the user to see the data that is being filtered as they type and would make it easier to see the data that is being filtered.
